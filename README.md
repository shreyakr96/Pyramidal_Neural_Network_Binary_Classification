This project involves the implementation of the neural network design algorithm given in “Binary Classification by SVM Based Tree Type Neural Networks” IEEE 2002 by Jayadeva et al. which seeks to constructively add neurons to a pyramidal neural network to identify the optimal ANN architecture for binary classification. This work was done as a part of a summer internship at IIT Delhi, under the guidance of professor Jayadeva.

The details for using these functions are available in the PDF report titled 'internship15.pdf'
